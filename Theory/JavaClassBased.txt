ðŸŒŸ WHY MUST WE HAVE A CLASS IN JAVA? ðŸŒŸ
âœ… IT IS A BLUEPRINT
        A CLASS DEFINES THE STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOR OF OBJECTS â€” THINK OF IT AS A TEMPLATE.

âœ… JAVA REQUIRES EVERYTHING (EXCEPT A FEW STATIC THINGS) TO BE INSIDE A CLASS
        NO STANDALONE CODE FLOATING AROUND â€” JAVA LOVES STRUCTURE!

âœ… IT PROMOTES MODULARITY, REUSABILITY, AND ORGANIZATION OF CODE
       WRITE ONCE, USE MANY TIMES. CLEAN AND ORGANIZED.

âœ… YOU CAN CREATE MULTIPLE OBJECTS FROM ONE CLASS â€” SUPER EFFICIENT!
        ONE CLASS, MANY OBJECTS. MEMORY-FRIENDLY AND LOGICAL.

âœ… HELPS WITH OOP PRINCIPLES: ENCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION, INHERITANCE, POLYMORPHISM
        CLASSES ARE THE CORE OF OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN JAVA.
